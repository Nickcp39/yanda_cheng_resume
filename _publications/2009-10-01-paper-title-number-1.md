### Significance
There is an essential need to develop wearable multimodality technologies that can continuously measure both blood flow and oxygenation in deep tissues to investigate and manage various vascular/cellular diseases.

### Aim
To develop a wearable dual-wavelength diffuse speckle contrast flow oximetry (DSCFO) for simultaneous measurements of blood flow and oxygenation variations in deep tissues.

### Approach
A wearable fiber-free DSCFO probe was fabricated using 3D printing to confine two small near-infrared laser diodes and a tiny CMOS camera in positions for DSCFO measurements. The spatial diffuse speckle contrast and light intensity measurements at the two different wavelengths enable quantification of tissue blood flow and oxygenation, respectively. The DSCFO was first calibrated using tissue phantoms and then tested in adult forearms during artery cuff occlusion.
