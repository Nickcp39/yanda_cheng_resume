### Introduction
Chronic leg ulcers affect approximately 6.5 million Americans, leading to significant mortality, reduced quality of life, and high treatment costs. Accurate assessment of tissue perfusion is crucial for effective treatment planning and monitoring. Our study leverages dual-scan photoacoustic tomography (PAT) to provide comprehensive imaging of the foot's vascular structure in a reduced timeframe.

### Technology Overview
The dual-scan PAT system uniquely combines imaging capabilities for both the dorsal and plantar sides of the foot, utilizing height-adjustable and articulating baseball stages that conform to the foot’s contour. This design allows for detailed and efficient imaging processes.

### Research Findings
In vivo testing on healthy volunteers has demonstrated the system’s capability to produce clear images of foot vasculature. Further tests on patients with various ulcer conditions have shown promising results. The study also explores different photoacoustic features and their potential applications in clinical settings.

### Citations and Impact
As of 2024, this paper has been cited 4 times, reflecting its initial impact within the field of medical imaging and diagnostics.
