**Investor**
======
Over the past decade, my investment portfolio has flourished across diverse arenas such as <span style="font-size: larger; color: #E7DAD2;">real estate</span>, technology stocks, and cryptocurrencies, each contributing significantly to my financial success.

<span style="font-size: larger; color: #BEB8DC;">Real Estate Investments:</span> I have strategically acquired properties in major global economic centers including <span style="font-size: larger; color: #82B0D2;">Beijing, California, Toronto, Xi'an, Yunnan, and Shanghai</span>. These investments have not only yielded rich dividends but also provided a stable foundation for my portfolio, balancing out more volatile sectors.

<span style="font-size: larger; color: #BEB8DC;">Technology Stocks:</span> My equity investments are carefully chosen, focusing on technology giants like <span style="font-size: larger; color: #82B0D2;">Apple, NVIDIA, and Microsoft</span>, known for their consistent innovation and stable growth. My enthusiasm for NVIDIA stems from their pioneering work with <span style="font-size: larger; color: #82B0D2;">GPT</span> models and AI technologies, which I believe are crucial for future technological advancements. While these investments have brought in annual returns of <span style="font-size: larger; color: #FFBE7A;">17% to 25%</span>, I have consciously avoided Tesla due to its unpredictable market performance, which does not align with my investment criteria.

<span style="font-size: larger; color: #BEB8DC;">Cryptocurrency Ventures:</span> Four years ago, I recognized the transformative potential of Bitcoin and decided to invest, anticipating its rise as a mainstream method of transaction. This decision has resulted in extraordinary gains, with returns ranging from <span style="font-size: larger; color: #FA7F6F;">100% to 300%</span>, exemplifying the lucrative potential of well-timed investments in emerging markets.

Insight and Global Perspective: Beyond mere financial gains, I am deeply involved in analyzing market trends and investment opportunities. I write extensive investment and research reports and travel extensively to assess economic conditions and real estate markets firsthand. These activities not only enhance my understanding but also ensure that my investment decisions are based on comprehensive global insights.




**Photographer**
======
------
I am a  <span style="color: #82B0D2;">photographer</span> with extensive experience spanning over <span style="color: #FFBE7A;">6+</span> years, specializing in capturing dynamic human expressions and urban landscapes. My photographic journey is highlighted by my leadership of a large <span style="color: #BEB8DC;">photography club</span> comprising over <span style="color: #FFBE7A;">100+ members</span>, where I orchestrated the documentation of countless events ranging from grand festival celebrations to intimate gatherings. This vast community allowed me to refine my skills across diverse settings, making each event a unique showcase of my ability to capture compelling stories through my lens.

Now working independently, I thrive as a freelance <span style="color: #82B0D2;">street and portrait photographer</span>. My expertise lies in revealing the intricate beauty and raw emotions of day-to-day activities, which I portray through my adept use of natural light and composition. My focus on <span style="color: #BEB8DC;">street photography</span> and <span style="color: #FFBE7A;">portraiture</span> enables me to produce striking images that resonate with authenticity and artistic flair. Managing a photography group of <span style="color: #FFBE7A;">100+ individuals</span> has not only bolstered my organizational capabilities but also enriched my perspective, allowing me to capture a broad spectrum of human experiences with my camera.




Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
