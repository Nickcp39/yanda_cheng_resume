**Fourth Year PhD Student**:  Researcher in Optical Technologies, AI, and ML
======

Welcome to my academic and professional portfolio. I am a Research Assistant in [Dr. Jun xia's lab](https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~junxia/). at the University of Buffalo, where my research focuses on applying advanced AI technologies like deep learning and machine learning to biomedical challenges, including image denoising and the use of GPT models.

 Previously, at [Cornell University](https://www.bme.cornell.edu/bme/alumni/bme-newsletters/2021-bme-newsletter/class-2021-special-insert), I had the opportunity to work under [Professor Karl Lewis](https://www.kjlewislab.com/group-members), contributing to several innovative projects related to rat motion and surgical reconstruction with. 

My initial work at the University of Kentucky involved developing technology for long-term monitoring of infant blood pressure using optical cameras. Under the where [Dr. Yu Guoqiang](https://bioptics.engr.uky.edu/) supervised on advanced optical and biomedical devices.  


<strong>Entrepreneur</strong>: Innovating in High-Tech Sensor Engineering and Development
======
I am an entrepreneur and a core developer at a leading high-tech company specializing in <span style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; color: #3b6291;">precision sensors</span>. Known for our advanced <span style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; color: #943c39;">laser</span> and <span style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; color: #779043;">ultrasonic sensors</span>, we excel in delivering products with high precision, superior quality, and competitive pricing. Having joined the company part-time in <strong style="font-size: larger; color: #624c7c;">2015</strong>, I have dedicated nearly a <strong style="font-size: larger; color: #388498;">DECADE</strong> to enhancing our technological capabilities and expanding our market presence. My extensive experience in both development and market strategy has been instrumental in driving our success and innovation.

Our operations currently extend across major markets such as <span style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; color: #bf7334;">Thailand</span>, <span style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; color: #3f6899;">Singapore</span>, the <span style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; color: #9c403d;">United States</span>, and <span style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; color: #7d9847;">China</span>.

This journey of over eight years reflects my dedication to innovation and excellence in the high-tech sensor industry, highlighting my role in driving the company's success and technological advancement.




**Investor**
======
Over the past decade, my investment portfolio has flourished across diverse arenas such as <span style="font-size: larger; color: #E7DAD2;">real estate</span>, technology stocks, and cryptocurrencies, each contributing significantly to my financial success.

<span style="font-size: larger; color: #BEB8DC;">Real Estate Investments:</span> I have strategically acquired properties in major global economic centers including <span style="font-size: larger; color: #82B0D2;">Beijing, California, Toronto, Xi'an, Yunnan, and Shanghai</span>. These investments have not only yielded rich dividends but also provided a stable foundation for my portfolio, balancing out more volatile sectors.

<span style="font-size: larger; color: #BEB8DC;">Technology Stocks:</span> My equity investments are carefully chosen, focusing on technology giants like <span style="font-size: larger; color: #82B0D2;">Apple, NVIDIA, and Microsoft</span>, known for their consistent innovation and stable growth. My enthusiasm for NVIDIA stems from their pioneering work with <span style="font-size: larger; color: #82B0D2;">GPT</span> models and AI technologies, which I believe are crucial for future technological advancements. While these investments have brought in annual returns of <span style="font-size: larger; color: #FFBE7A;">17% to 25%</span>, I have consciously avoided Tesla due to its unpredictable market performance, which does not align with my investment criteria.

<span style="font-size: larger; color: #BEB8DC;">Cryptocurrency Ventures:</span> Four years ago, I recognized the transformative potential of Bitcoin and decided to invest, anticipating its rise as a mainstream method of transaction. This decision has resulted in extraordinary gains, with returns ranging from <span style="font-size: larger; color: #FA7F6F;">100% to 300%</span>, exemplifying the lucrative potential of well-timed investments in emerging markets.

Insight and Global Perspective: Beyond mere financial gains, I am deeply involved in analyzing market trends and investment opportunities. I write extensive investment and research reports and travel extensively to assess economic conditions and real estate markets firsthand. These activities not only enhance my understanding but also ensure that my investment decisions are based on comprehensive global insights.
